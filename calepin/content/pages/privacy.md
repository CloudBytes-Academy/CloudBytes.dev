UberPython.com ("UberPython", "we", or "us) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains the methods and reasons we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. If you have any questions about the contents of this policy, don’t hesitate to contact us.

If you do not consent to the collection and use of information from or about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy, then you are not permitted to use UberPython or any services provided on https://UberPython.com.

# What do we mean by "Personal Information"?
For us, "personal information" means information which either directly identifies you (like your name, email address, or billing information) or can be reasonably linked or combined to identify you (like an account identification number or IP address). We’ll always tell you what personal information we’re collecting from you.

Any information that falls outside of this is "non-personal information."

If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information. If we remove all personal information from a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information.
