TL;DR - [Minify you Pelican Website](#)

[Minification](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/MinifyResources) of wesite resources is an essential step for good PageSpeed / Lighthouse scores, and as I've bragged in past, [CloudBytes/dev](https://cloudbytes.dev) scores a perfect 100.

This is partly because Website generated by [SSGs]({filename}0004-what-is-jamstack.md) are generally faster than the ones generated using CMS solutions like WordPress, etc. But the main reason is non-redundant JS & CSS code. 

To make websites faster still, you minify the contents of all the HTML, CSS & JS files which typically results in smaller file sizes that consequently means faster load times for users.
