Summary: How to configure S3 lifecycle rules like expiration and transition

Lifecycle rules allow you to configure the lifecycle of objects in your S3 bucket. You can configure lifecycle rules to expire or transition objects to different storage classes.


## Configure Lifecycle Rules

You can configure lifecycle rules on the S3 bucket by using the `add_lifecycle_rule` method of the `Bucket` construct.

```python
# filename: cdk_app/s3_stack.py

from aws_cdk import (
    Stack,
    aws_s3 as s3,
    RemovalPolicy,
    Duration,  # üëàüèΩ Import the Duration class
)

from constructs import Construct


class S3Stack(Stack):
    BUCKET_ID = "MyS3Bucket"

    def __init__(self, scope: Construct, construct_id: str, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(scope, construct_id, **kwargs)

        my_bucket = s3.Bucket(
            self,
            id=self.BUCKET_ID,
            # üëáüèΩ Set the lifecycle rules
            lifecycle_rules=[
                s3.LifecycleRule(
                    enabled=True,
                    expiration=Duration.days(14),
                )
            ],
            removal_policy=RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
        )
```

In the above code, we have set the following lifecycle rules:

1. `enabled=True` - Enable the lifecycle rule
2. `expiration=Duration.days(14)` - Delete the objects after 14 days

You also configure transition rules by setting the `transitions` property of the `LifecycleRule` class.

```python
# filename: cdk_app/s3_stack.py

from aws_cdk import (
    Stack,
    aws_s3 as s3,
    RemovalPolicy,
    Duration,  # üëàüèΩ Import the Duration class
)

from constructs import Construct


class S3Stack(Stack):
    BUCKET_ID = "MyS3Bucket"

    def __init__(self, scope: Construct, construct_id: str, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(scope, construct_id, **kwargs)

        my_bucket = s3.Bucket(
            self,
            self.BUCKET_ID,
            # üëáüèΩ Set the lifecycle rules
            lifecycle_rules=[
                s3.LifecycleRule(
                    enabled=True,
                    transitions=[
                        s3.Transition(
                            storage_class=s3.StorageClass.INFREQUENT_ACCESS,
                            transition_after=Duration.days(30),
                        ),
                        s3.Transition(
                            storage_class=s3.StorageClass.GLACIER,
                            transition_after=Duration.days(60),
                        ),
                    ],
                )
            ],
            removal_policy=RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
        )
```

In the above example, we have set the following transition rules:

1. `storage_class=s3.StorageClass.INFREQUENT_ACCESS` - Move the objects to infrequent access storage class after 30 days
2. `storage_class=s3.StorageClass.GLACIER` - Move the objects to Glacier storage class after 60 days
