[TOC]

EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) is the original IaaS cloud service launched by Amazon in the mid-2000s which since then has launched the new era of cloud computing.

EC2 allows you to create an manage a virtual machine (VM) in cloud without having to worry about the hardware or virtualisation software.

## How to create an EC2 instance?

We will create an EC2 instance in this tutorial using the [AWS Management Console](#create-an-ec2-instance-using-aws-management-console). 

If you're looking for a tutorial on how to create EC2 instance using the AWS Console, please see below

### Create an EC2 instance using AWS Management Console

To create an EC2 instance using AWS Management Console, we need to do the following:

1. [Go to the AWS Management Console](#1-go-to-the-aws-management-console)
2. [Choose a region](#2-choose-a-region): In this tutorial, we will use us-east-1.
3. [Launch the instance](#3-launch-the-instance): Click on the Launch Instance button.
4. [Choose Name](#4-choose-name): Give the instance a name.
5. [Choose the AMI](#5-choose-the-ami): In this tutorial, we will use the Amazon Linux AMI.
6. [Choose the instance type](#6-choose-the-instance-type): In this tutorial, we will use t2.micro.
7. [Choose the key pair](#7-choose-the-key-pair): The key pair that you want to use to log into the instance.
8. [Choose the Availability Zone / Subnet](#8-choose-the-availability-zone-subnet): In this tutorial, we will use us-east-1a.
9. [Choose the security group](#9-choose-the-security-group): In this tutorial, we will create a new security group that permits SSH access.
10. [Choose Storage](#10-choose-storage): In this tutorial, we will use an `gp2` volume of 20GB
11. [Launch the instance](#11-launch-the-instance): Click on the Launch Instance button.


#### 1. Go to the AWS Management Console

a) Login to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) and search for EC2 and then go to the EC2 console.

d) Enter a name for the security group. E.g., I chose the name `my-web-sg` the change the description to `Web security group`  


#### 9. Choose the security group
e) Under **Inbound secruity groups rules**, click on **Add security group rule**

#### 11. Launch the instance

a) Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on **Launch instance** button under **Summary**  
b) Wait for the instance to be created, after success, scroll down to the bottom and click on **View all instances** button 
c) If you don't see anything, hit the refresh icon at the top

Now your EC2 instance is created. Select the instance, at the bottom you should see the public IPv4 address. You can use this address to access the instance.

## Logging into the EC2 instance

a) With he IP address, we can log into the instance. Open a terminal and run the following command to log into the instance.

```bash
ssh -i my-key-pair.pem ec2-user@$INSTANCE_IP
```

You may be asked for confirmation similar to below, type Yes and press enter.

```text
The authenticity of host '54.173.196.189 (54.173.196.189)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:jm9pK6nGCsOVkQKfeQTG080hrb3G8Y2k1jeDwkNF4Og.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

This should log you into the instance.
