Ubuntu both Desktop & WSL2 Linux systems come with Python installed by default, but, they are usually not the latest. This is a short guide on how to upgrade your Python to the latest version (Python 3.13) on Ubuntu Linux and solve associated issues.

I am using Ubuntu 22.04 on WSL2, but this should work on any Ubuntu version.

First, check the version of Python installed on your system run
```bash
python3 --version
```
> `python` keyword is used for Python 2.x versions which has been deprecated



## Updating Python to the latest version 
Ubuntu's default repositories do not contain the latest version of Python, but an open source repository named `deadsnakes` does.

### Step 1: Check if Python3.13 is available for install

First, update your system by running

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update
```

Check if Python 3.13 is available by running

```bash
apt list | grep python3.13
```

This will produce the below result, if you see python3.13 it means you can install it

If you see something similar to the above, it means you can install Python 3.13.

### Step 2: Install Python 3.13
Now you can install Python 3.13 by running

```bash 
sudo apt install python3.13
```

Now though Python 3.13 is installed, if you check the version of your python by running `python3 --version` you will still see an older version. This is because if you are using Ubuntu Desktop, the default Python is needed by the system and changing it will break your system.

### Step 3: Run Python 3.13

You can run Python 3.13 by running

```bash
python3.13 --version
```

**The right way to run Python 3.13 On Linux Desktops is by using a virtual environment.**

E.g. you can create a new virtual environment by running

```bash
sudo python3.13 -m venv venv
python3.13 -m venv env
```

and activate it by running

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

Now you can run `python --version` and you should see the latest version of Python as the output.

### Extra
If you really, really, really don't want to type `python3.13` every time you want to run a file, you can create an alias. 

If you are using bash, run
```bash
echo "alias py=/usr/bin/python3" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "alias python=/usr/bin/python3" >> ~/.bashrc
```


Or, if you have [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) installed, you can avoid typing out `python3` by running
```bash
echo "alias py=/usr/bin/python3" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "alias python=/usr/bin/python3" >> ~/.zshrc
omz reload
```
After restarting your terminal, you can run your Python apps with `py` or `python`.


## WSL2 Only: Set Python 3.13 as default
> !!! warning "Steps beyond here are tested on WSL2, it may break your Ubuntu/Linux desktop."


Changing the default alternatives for Python will break your Gnome terminal. To avoid this, you need to edit the `gnome-terminal` configuration file.

Open the terminal and run:
```bash
sudo nano /usr/bin/gnome-terminal
```
In first line, change `#!/usr/bin/python3` to `#!/usr/bin/python3.8`. Press `Ctrl +X` followed by `enter` to save and exit.

Then save and close the file.


Next, update the default Python by adding both versions to an alternatives by running the below
```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.9 1
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.13 2
```

Now run 
```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config python3
```

Choose the selection corresponding to Python3.10 (if not selected by default).

Now run `python3 --version` again and you should see the latest Python as the output.

## Fix pip and disutils errors

Installing the new version of Python will break `pip` as the `distutils` for Python3.13 is not installed yet.

### Fix Python3-apt 
Running `pip` in terminal will not work, as the current pip is not compatible with Python3.13 and python3-apt will be broken, that will generate an error like
```text
Traceback (most recent call last):   
    File "/usr/lib/command-not-found", line 28, in <module>     
        from CommandNotFound import CommandNotFound   
    File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/CommandNotFound/CommandNotFound.py", line 19, in <module>     
        from CommandNotFound.db.db import SqliteDatabase   
    File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/CommandNotFound/db/db.py", line 5, in <module>     
        import apt_pkg ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'apt_pkg'
```

To fix this first remove the current version of python3-apt by running
```bash
sudo apt remove --purge python3-apt
```

Then do some cleanup
```bash
sudo apt autoclean
```

!!! danger "DO NOT RUN `sudo apt autoremove` as it will remove several packages that are required. This may break your system if you're using GUI, if you're on WSL2 you can proceed."

Finally, reinstall `python3-apt` by running

```bash
sudo apt install python3-apt
```

###  Install pip & distutils

Running `pip`  will still throw an error `pip: command not found`. We need to install the latest version of pip compatible with Python 3.13. 

Also, if try to manually install the latest version of pip, it will throw an error like
```text
ImportError: cannot import name 'sysconfig' from 'distutils' 
(/usr/lib/python3.13/distutils/__init__.py)
```
Or you might also see an error stating `No module named 'distutils.util'`. This is because the `distutils` module is not installed yet, to install run the below command

```bash
sudo apt install python3.13-distutils
```

Now you can install `pip` by running

```bash
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
sudo python3.13 get-pip.py
```
> If you get an error like `bash: curl: command not found` then you need to install curl first by running `sudo apt install curl`

Now you can run `pip` and you should see the output of `pip --version`

### Fix pip-env errors when using venv
When you try to create a new virtual environment using `python -m venv env`, you may into the following error. 
```bash
Error: Command '['/path/to/env/bin/python3', '-Im', 'ensurepip', '--upgrade', '--default-pip']' returned non-zero exit status 1
```

You can fix this by reinstalling venv by running
```bash
sudo apt install python3.13-venv
```

All should be done now. It is complicated, but this is how you update Python to latest version.
